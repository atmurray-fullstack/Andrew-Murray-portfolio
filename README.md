# Andrew-Murray-portfolio

This project involved creating a landing page, portfolio page, and a contact page. The project uses Html5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The application is responsive across xs, sm, med, and lg screens. The landing page contains information about me including links to my github profile, LinkedIn profile and my resume. The portfolio page contains my group project Crypto Exchange and two homeworks; Weather Forecast and Dayplanner . The contact page is set up in order to allow messages to be sent to the user in the future. The footer on all the pages contains my phone number and email.
